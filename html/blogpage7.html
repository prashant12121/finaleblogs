                    <p>Death Note (Japanese: デスノート, Hepburn: Desu Nōto) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi
                        Ohba
                        and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who stumbles
                        across
                        a mysterious otherworldly notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk and
                        grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The
                        series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide
                        massacre of individuals whom he deems morally unworthy of life to change the world into a
                        utopian
                        society without crime, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira" and the subsequent
                        efforts of an elite task-force of law enforcement officers, consisting of members of the
                        Japanese
                        police force, led by L, an enigmatic international detective whose past is shrouded in mystery,
                        to
                        apprehend him and end his reign of terror.

                        Death Note was first serialized in Shueisha's manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December
                        2003
                        to May 2006. The 108 chapters were collected and published into 12 tankōbon volumes between
                        April
                        2004 and July 2006. An anime television adaptation aired in Japan from October 2006 to June
                        2007.
                        Composed of 37 episodes, the anime was developed by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki. A
                        light
                        novel based on the series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally,
                        various
                        video games have been published by Konami for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three
                        live action films released in Japan in June 2006, November 2006, and February 2008, and a
                        television
                        drama in 2015. A miniseries entitled Death Note: New Generation and a fourth film were released
                        in
                        2016. An American film adaptation was released exclusively on Netflix in August 2017 and a
                        sequel is
                        reportedly in the works.

                        In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death
                        Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the
                        target's
                        name and face. After verifying that the notebook works and initially being terrified of its
                        god-like
                        abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and sets out
                        to
                        create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before
                        eventually targeting international criminals and felons around the world. Five days after
                        discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami", beings inspired by the
                        Japanese
                        god of death and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not
                        touched the Death Note, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom
                        and
                        is amused by Light's actions.[5]

                        As numerous criminals and convicts around the world begin to die of inexplicable freak accidents
                        and
                        heart attacks, the global media begin to believe that a single mastermind is responsible for the
                        mysterious murders and name him "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the English word
                        "killer"), who is both feared and beloved by the public and law enforcement agencies. Hoping to
                        apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic and highly esteemed
                        international
                        consulting detective, known as L, who has cracked numerous crime cases around the world, to
                        assist
                        them in the investigation. After deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L stages a TV broadcast
                        in
                        which he tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him
                        to
                        kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L quickly
                        deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police's investigation, which is led by
                        Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that "Kira" could have familial connections
                        with the members of the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the
                        families
                        of those connected with the investigation, but Light outmaneuvers and kills them all.
                        Nonetheless, L
                        picks up enough hints to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates
                        from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with both trying to get
                        the
                        other to reveal crucial information.

                        At this point, a famous model/actress named Misa Amane gains a second Death Note from a
                        Shinigami
                        named Rem. Misa makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami eyes, which allows her to kill knowing only
                        the
                        face at the cost of half her lifespan. Misa commits numerous murders, sends taped recordings to
                        the
                        police, and eventually uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira. Infatuated with Light,
                        she
                        demands Light be her boyfriend. Although he does not love Misa, Light agrees, intending to use
                        Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. However, before she can do so, L deduces that
                        Misa
                        is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem, who has feelings for Misa, threatens to kill
                        Light
                        if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily
                        lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven
                        individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. Now with no knowledge of the Death Note, Light
                        wholeheartedly joins the investigation. Together, Light and L deduce Higuchi's identity, arrest
                        him,
                        and discover the existence of the Death Notes and the Shinigami. When they touch the Death Note,
                        Light and Misa regain their memories, and Light kills Higuchi with a piece of the Death Note,
                        regaining possession of the book. However, L casts suspicion on Misa, forcing Rem to murder L to
                        save her. Rem dies in the process, as it is forbidden for Shinigami to prevent humans from
                        dying.
                        The task force agrees to cover up L's death and appoint Light as the new L. The investigation
                        stalls
                        as a result.

                        Four years later, crime rates worldwide have massively dropped, but cults have arisen which
                        adore
                        Kira. Two intelligent young men, who were raised as potential successors to L, are revealed:
                        Near
                        and Mello. Both are aware that L is dead, and thus consider Light, the current L, a prime
                        suspect.
                        Mello, with the Mafia's assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death
                        during
                        the rescue mission. As suspicion starts to fall again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to
                        a
                        fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints a well-known newscaster, Kiyomi Takada
                        as
                        Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her.
                        Takada
                        kills Mello with a hidden page of the Death Note but is killed by Light in order to dispel
                        suspicions. Shortly after, Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting
                        between
                        Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light seizes the chance to have Mikami kill Near
                        as
                        well as all the task force members. However, Mikami's Death Note fails to work. It is revealed
                        that
                        Near had replaced Mikami's Death Note with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down,
                        only
                        Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. A scuffle breaks out during which Light is
                        grievously wounded. Ryuk, realizing that Light will spend the rest of his life in prison, writes
                        down Light's name in his Death Note—as he had promised to do at the beginning of the story. A
                        year
                        passes after Light's death, and while the world seems to have returned to normal, a large cult
                        has
                        secretly amassed, worshipping Kira as their god and savior.
