                    <p>Plot
                        A young girl named Fuu is working as a waitress in a tea shop when she is abused by a band of
                        samurai. She is saved by a mysterious rogue named Mugen and a young rōnin named Jin. Mugen
                        attacks
                        Jin after he proves to be a worthy opponent. The pair begin fighting one another and
                        inadvertently
                        cause the death of Shibui Tomonoshina, the magistrate's son. For this crime, they are to be
                        executed. With help from Fuu, they are able to escape execution. In return, Fuu asks them to
                        travel
                        with her to find "the samurai who smells of sunflowers".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Setting and style
                        According to the director, the series is set during the Edo period, roughly sixty years after
                        the
                        end of the Sengoku period.[4] Samurai Champloo employs a blend of historical Edo-period
                        backdrops
                        with modern styles and references. The show relies on factual events of Edo-era Japan, such as
                        the
                        Shimabara Rebellion ("Unholy Union"; "Evanescent Encounter, Part I"); Dutch exclusivity in an
                        era in
                        which an edict restricted Japanese foreign relations ("Stranger Searching"); ukiyo-e paintings
                        ("Artistic Anarchy"); and fictionalized versions of real-life Edo personalities like Mariya
                        Enshirou
                        and Miyamoto Musashi ("Elegy of Entrapment, Verse 2"). The content and accuracy of the
                        historical
                        content is often distorted via artistic license.

                        Historical context and Western influence
                        Samurai Champloo contains many scenes and episodes relating to historical occurrences in Japan's
                        Edo
                        period. In episode 5 ("Artistic Anarchy"), Fuu is kidnapped by the famous ukiyo-e painter
                        Hishikawa
                        Moronobu, a figure prominent in the Edo period's art scene.[5] Episode 23 ("Baseball Blues")
                        pits
                        the main characters in a baseball game against Alexander Cartwright and a team of American
                        baseball
                        players trying to declare war on Japan.[6] As for Western influences, the opening of the show as
                        well as many of the soundtracks are influenced by hip hop.[7] In episode 5, Vincent van Gogh is
                        referenced at the end in relation to Hishikawa Moronobu's ukiyo-e paintings.[8] A hip hop singer
                        challenges the main characters in episode 8 ("The Art of Altercation") and uses break dance
                        throughout.[9] In episode 18 ("War of the Words"), graffiti tagging, a culturally Western art
                        form,
                        is performed by characters as an artistic expression and form of writing. The ending of the
                        episode
                        has Mugen writing his name on the roof of Hiroshima Castle, the palace of the daimyō in Edo
                        Japan
                    </p>

                        Fuu: A spirited 15-year-old girl, Fuu asks Mugen and Jin to help her find a sparsely described
                        man
                        she calls "the samurai who smells of sunflowers". Her father left her and her mother for an
                        unknown
                        reason. Without her father around to support them, Fuu and her mother led a difficult life until
                        her
                        mother died of illness. After a not-so-successful stint as a teahouse waitress/dancer she saves
                        Mugen and Jin from execution and recruits them as her bodyguards. A flying squirrel named "Momo"
                        (short for momonga, "flying squirrel") accompanies her, inhabiting her kimono and frequently
                        leaping
                        out to her rescue. Her name, Fuu, is the character for "wind". In the title cards, her totem is
                        Sunflowers.

                        Mugen: A brash vagabond from the penal colony of the Ryukyu Islands, Mugen is a 19-year-old
                        wanderer
                        with a wildly unconventional fighting style. Rude, lewd, vulgar, conceited, temperamental and
                        psychotic, he is something of an antihero. He is fond of fighting and has a tendency to pick
                        fights
                        for petty reasons. It is implied in a few episodes that he is also a womanizer, with his libido
                        sometimes getting the better of him. He wears metal-soled geta and carries an exotic sai-handled
                        sword on his back. In Japanese, the word mugen means "infinite" (literally, "without limit" or
                        "limitless"). He was a former pirate. In the title cards, his totem is the rooster.
