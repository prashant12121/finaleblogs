                    <p>Rukia Kuchiki (朽木 ルキア, Kuchiki Rukia) is the current captain of the 13th Division. She formerly
                        served as lieutenant of the 13th Division under Captain Jūshirō Ukitake. Rukia is the adoptive
                        sister of Byakuya Kuchiki and a friend of Ichigo Kurosaki.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personality
                        Initially born into a lower class, Rukia retains her modesty, even as an adopted member of the
                        nobility. She is graceful and "clean", yet chooses to talk to ordinary people. However, her cool
                        and
                        lone demeanor often forces her to hide her personal troubles, even from her friends. According
                        to
                        Ukitake, Rukia never opens up her heart, and has difficulty making friends.[5] Rukia is clueless
                        about the ways of the modern Human World.[6][7][8][9] She is very good at acting, having acted
                        her
                        way through a number of tough situations, such as getting out of trouble with school
                        teachers[10]
                        and convincing the Kurosaki family to let her stay at their house.[11]

                        Rukia always has trouble finding clothes that fit her, especially when inhabiting a Gigai in the
                        Human World,[1] leading to her stealing clothes from Ichigo's sister, Yuzu.[12] She likes to
                        climb
                        to high places.[1] Rukia likes everything rabbit-themed,[13] and becomes quite sensitive when
                        someone insults her obsession with them.[14] People often have difficulty understanding her
                        drawings, which are typically rabbit-like, and doesn't like it when people complain about their
                        quality.[15][16][17] Rukia's favorite foods are cucumber, eggs, and rice dumplings.

                        Creation and conception
                        Bleach was first conceived from Tite Kubo's desire to draw a shinigami in a kimono, which formed
                        the
                        basis for the design of the Soul Reapers.[2] Because of this, Kuchiki was one of the first
                        characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo
                        thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed
                        as
                        he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead
                        character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist, with Rukia being the
                        first
                        female lead.[6] Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's
                        appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.[7]

                        As for her name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki "looks like a shinigami", he wanted her name
                        to
                        sound like something a shinigami would have as a name. When deciding upon her family name he
                        considered using "Kuchiru" (朽ちる, lit. "to rot") because it sounded like a name a shinigami would
                        have, and then decided to use "Kuchiki" (朽木, lit. "rotten wood"). He adds that he once heard
                        something that sounded like "Kuchiki Rukia" on Japanese television, and liked it enough to use
                        it as
                        a name.[6] Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on
                        television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which
                        her
                        name is derived means "light" and Kubo sees her as "a ray of light for Ichigo." Shonen Jump
                        asked in
                        an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to
                        confirm nor deny it.[8] After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made
                        it
                        to be the most beautiful one from the series.[9]

                        When Kubo was asked to make a cover with a female character during Christmas, Kubo initially
                        thought
                        of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable
                        for
                        such role. Additionally, after the second anime season/manga arc, Orihime replaced Rukia as the
                        true
                        female lead for the rest of the series. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas
                        illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to see the image.
                        In
                        contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face
                        expresses pain such as when she is going to be executed in the manga
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rukia meets Ichigo in the midst of a hollow attack. After suffering her injuries, Rukia
                        transfers
                        her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves.[11] While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too
                        weak to
                        return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her
                        powers
                        are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in
                        strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking
                        others.[12] Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a
                        keen
                        understanding of his inner workings.[13] Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite
                        the
                        relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and
                        considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling.[14]
                        During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya
                        Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society.[15] They
                        succeed,
                        and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human.
                        Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her
                        to
                        safety.[16]

                        During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as an infant and was sent to Soul Society
                        with
                        her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana initially tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she
                        could
                        not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia.[17] As
                        Rukia
                        grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted
                        into the Kuchiki family.[18] One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her
                        husband,
                        Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya
                        confesses it to her.[17] When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the
                        lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him.[19] During the course of a
                        mission,
                        Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him
