                    <p>Itachi Uchiha (Japanese: うちは イタチ, Hepburn: Uchiha Itachi) is a fictional
                        character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto.
                        Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and is responsible for killing all
                        the members of their clan, sparing only his younger brother Sasuke. He appears
                        working as a terrorist from the organization Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's
                        greatest enemy. During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in
                        terrorist attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast creatures until facing
                        Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel,
                        it is later revealed Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha
                        clan. Itachi has appeared once in an original video animation of rustage, and is
                        a playable character in most of the video games from the series.

                        Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga,[6] and has been
                        positively received by critics. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised
                        by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be
                        unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story
                        has also received positive reception,[7][8] and his fights were noted to be "one
                        of the best" in the series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of merchandise have been
                        released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.

                        Creation and design
                        When Itachi Uchiha is first mentioned by Sasuke Uchiha in the manga, Masashi
                        Kishimoto had not planned out the character's backstory. The only idea he had
                        was to attribute to Itachi some violent action that would have Sasuke wanting to
                        kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make
                        Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clan under their orders.[12] Itachi
                        was originally conceived as the leader of Konoha's Special Assassination and
                        Tactical Squad called the "Anbu", dubbed the Itachi Squad (イタチ隊, Itachi-tai),
                        which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specializing in
                        assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in
                        favor of the current Itachi working for the Akatsuki.[13] From all the Akatsuki
                        characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his
                        backstory.[14]

                        Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often talked with Sasuke's
                        Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their characters. When the two
                        characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre
                        of the Uchiha clan hard to believe and started to read the Naruto manga in order
                        to see if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors
                        noted that in the end Itachi served as a good older brother to Sasuke.[15]
                        English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how
                        many times he revisited the series.[16]

                    <p>
                        Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the
                        elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha
                        clan, establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to
                        live up to.[17] His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which
                        caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a
                        coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking
                        the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his
                        clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi
                        distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his
                        best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyo
                        Sharingan, lit. "Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye").[18][19][20]

                        In reality, as Shisui possesses the ability to subliminally manipulate others
                        and shares Itachi's love for the village, he intended to use his gift on the
                        Uchiha clan leader to stop the coup d'état. However, Shisui is mortally wounded
                        by the Leaf High Council member Danzo Shimura, who then takes his eye to achieve
                        his own ideal of peace. When Shisui entrusts Itachi with his remaining eye,
                        Itachi covers up Shisui's death to make it appear it was his doing. Eventually,
                        in return for Danzo's offer to spare his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his
                        entire clan.[21] After creating the misconception that he murdered their family
                        in cold blood to give Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him
                        once he is capable, Itachi leaves the village, although he warns Danzo not to
                        harm Sasuke. Meeting up with Konoha's Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, who
                        promises to do what he can to look after Sasuke, Itachi reveals his intentions
                        to continue to protect the village from the shadows.[22] Soon after perceiving
                        them as a threat to Konoha, Itachi joins the Akatsuki to ensure they do not
                        endanger his village. Itachi becomes good friends with his partner Kisame
                        Hoshigaki, who expresses concern for Itachi's wellbeing.[23]

                        Itachi debuts in Part I after Hiruzen's death, when he uses his infiltration of
                        Konoha to hunt down Naruto Uzumaki as an excuse to secretly check on Sasuke's
                        wellbeing.[24] After engaging with Kakashi Hatake and some of Konoha's forces,
                        he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki which are the people that
                        contained the tailed beasts which there are nine of. Itachi also learns that
                        Naruto is under the protection of Jiraiya and sets up a trap to lure the
                        experienced ninja away to grab the boy.[23][25] However, as Jiraiya comes to
                        Naruto's aid, Itachi finds himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back on
                        the path of getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall
                        back.[26][27]

                        In Part II, Itachi uses one of Sasori's informants as a clone of himself to hold
                        off Naruto and the rest of his team while he and the others seal away Shukaku
                        the One Tail.[28] Itachi remains on the sidelines until learning that Sasuke has
                        finally severed his ties to Orochimaru, having absorbed him and now being strong
                        enough to settle matters. Prior to his fight with Sasuke, Itachi meets with
                        Naruto and, after questioning his intentions to save Sasuke, ensures the youth's
                        safety with a crow with Shisui's Sharingan (写輪眼, lit. "Copy Wheel Eye", English
                        manga: "Mirror Wheel Eye") as a countermeasure against Sasuke if he gains his
                        Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and attempts to attack Konoha.[29] Sasuke ultimately
                        tracks him down and they engage in their final battle, during the course of
                        which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan to push Sasuke to his limits. In doing so,
                        Orochimaru is drawn out from Sasuke's body, and Itachi seals him away with his
                        Totsuka blade before finally succumbing to his mysterious illness.[30] As his
                        final act, Itachi implants his Amaterasu technique within Sasuke, meant as a
                        protective measure that will kill Tobi in case he ever tries to approach Sasuke
                        and reveal the truth of their clan's slaughter.[31] Unfortunately, having knew
                        where Itachi's loyalties truly lie, Tobi survived and reveals the truth of
                        Itachi's actions to Sasuke. This gives Sasuke a resolve to destroy the village,
                        eventually having his brother's Mangekyo Sharingan implanted on him.[22]

                        Itachi reappears later during the Fourth Great Ninja War, brought back by Kabuto
                        Yakushi using the Reanimation Jutsu, a forbidden summoning jutsu that brings the
                        dead back as immortal corpses, to fight on Tobi's side.[32] Paired with Nagato
                        and forced to fight Naruto and Killer Bee against his will, Itachi learns of his
                        brother's intentions and summons the crow he gave Naruto to regain his free
                        will.[33] After sealing Nagato,[33] Itachi heads out to stop Kabuto and
                        encounters Sasuke, with his younger brother wanting to know the truth once it is
                        over.[34][35]

                        After a long battle, Itachi is pushed to use Izanami to trap Kabuto in an
                        eternal time-loop in his own mind, to have him break his jutsu.[36][36][37][38]
                        His soul beginning to fade, Itachi uses his Sharingan to project his memories to
                        Sasuke to reveal the full story of the events leading to the Uchiha Clan
                        Massacre. Telling his brother that he does not have to forgive him, Itachi tells
                        Sasuke that he will always love him, no matter what choice he makes from then
                        on.[39] With his brother's parting words, and accepting defeat after his final
                        battle with Naruto, Sasuke renounces destroying the village and devotes himself
                        to protecting it, fulfilling Itachi's wish for his younger brother. Sasuke even
                        adopts Itachi's habit of poking on the forehead as a sign of affection, which
                        Sasuke does with his wife Sakura and their daughter Sarada Uchiha.[40][41]
