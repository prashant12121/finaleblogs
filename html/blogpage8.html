                    <p>Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER; pronounced "Hunter Hunter") is a Japanese manga
                        series
                        written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump since
                        March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. As of
                        October
                        2018, 380 chapters have been collected into 36 volumes by Shueisha. The story focuses on a young
                        boy
                        named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a
                        world
                        renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as
                        locating
                        rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting
                        down lawless individuals. Despite being abandoned by his father, Gon departs on a journey to
                        become
                        a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and
                        encounters the paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own
                        collecting
                        hobby.

                    <p>
                        In 1999, Hunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by
                        Nippon
                        Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi. The show premiered on Japan's Fuji TV and ran
                        until
                        2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently
                        produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television
                        series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014 totaling 148
                        episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio
                        albums,
                        video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.

                        The manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since
                        April
                        2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having
                        aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim's Toonami
                        block from April 2016 to June 2019.

                        Hunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of Shueisha's
                        best-selling manga series, having over 78 million copies in circulation as of November 2019.

                        Creation and design
                        When Itachi Uchiha is first mentioned by Sasuke Uchiha in the manga, Masashi
                        Kishimoto had not planned out the character's backstory. The only idea he had
                        was to attribute to Itachi some violent action that would have Sasuke wanting to
                        kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make
                        Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clan under their orders.[12] Itachi
                        was originally conceived as the leader of Konoha's Special Assassination and
                        Tactical Squad called the "Anbu", dubbed the Itachi Squad (イタチ隊, Itachi-tai),
                        which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specializing in
                        assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in
                        favor of the current Itachi working for the Akatsuki.[13] From all the Akatsuki
                        characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his
                        backstory.[14]

                        Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often talked with Sasuke's
                        Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their characters. When the two
                        characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre
                        of the Uchiha clan hard to believe and started to read the Naruto manga in order
                        to see if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors
                        noted that in the end Itachi served as a good older brother to Sasuke.[15]
                        English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how
                        many times he revisited the series.[16]

                        Hunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down
                        secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals. They can also access locations that
                        regulars cannot access.[3] To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter
                        Examination
                        run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a
                        hundred-thousand.[4] A
                        Hunter may be awarded up to three stars; a single star for making "remarkable achievements in a
                        particular field"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for "holding an official position" and
                        mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for
                        "remarkable achievements in multiple fields."[5]

                        Nen (念) is the ability to control one's own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted
                        from
                        them whether they know it or not. There are four basic Nen techniques; Ten (纏) maintains the
                        aura in
                        the body, strengthening it for defense, Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing
                        one's presence and relieving fatigue, Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen, and Hatsu (發)
                        is a
                        person's specific use of Nen.[6] Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu
                        abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities;
                        Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies; Manipulators (操作系, Sōsakei)
                        control
                        objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or properties of their
                        aura;
                        Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists (特質系,
                        Tokushitsukei)
                        have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories.[7] A Nen user can enter
                        into a
                        Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their
                        abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika
                        who,
                        in order to have an unbreakable chain that will hold members of the Phantom Troupe no matter
                        what,
                        offered his life should he use it on anyone other than its members.[8]

                        The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents
                        were dead. But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is
                        still
                        alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島,
                        Kujira
                        Tō) to take the Hunter Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like
                        him.[9][10][11] During the exam, Gon meets and soon befriends three of the other applicants:
                        Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to
                        avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a
                        band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to
                        pay
                        for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck,
                        another
                        twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious
                        assassin
                        family.[10][11][3] Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious
                        and
                        deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After passing by many trials together, Gon and
                        his
                        friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due
                        to
                        being controlled by his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.

                        After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart
                        temporarily for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena
                        (天空闘技場,
                        Tenkū Tōgijō), a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting
                        tournaments, seeking to improve themselves and gain monetary rewards.[12] There they meet a kung
                        fu
                        master named Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-life like energy used by its practicers
                        to
                        manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass
                        the
                        Hunter Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ,
                        Yōkushin
                        Shiti) where they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the occasion, two from the band
                        of
                        thieves are killed by Kurapika and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest
                        in
                        order to rescue Gon and Killua, who were captured by them, but not without succeeding in sealing
                        the
                        powers of their leader Chrollo Lucilfer.

                        A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing Greed Island, an
                        extremely rare and expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about
                        Ging's
                        whereabouts.[13] While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set
                        somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by none other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the
                        difficulty of the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit
                        Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With the help of Biscuit, Gon and
                        Killua
                        train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. During their stay on Greed
                        Island, Killua takes a short break to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes
                        with
                        success. The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to
                        choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.

                        However, Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but
                        they
                        send them to meet Kite instead. The duo then decide to help with Kite's research, and upon
                        discovering a giant insect limb the group discovers that it came from a man-sized Chimera Ant
                        queen,
                        an insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the
                        characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation
                        called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for
                        humans
                        and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring
                        learn
                        the power of Nen after consuming some Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants,
                        Kite
                        sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks
                        of
                        preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including
                        Netero,
                        the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king Meruem, whose
                        subjects
                        secretly overthrew the government of the nearby Republic of East Gorteau (東ゴルトー共和国) as part of
                        their
                        plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him
                        with
                        a bomb implanted in his body that poisons him to death soon after. In the occasion, Gon has a
                        showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite and despite having exacted his revenge is
                        hospitalized and in critical condition.

                        After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's top echelons the Zodiacs,
                        from
                        which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while
                        Killua
                        returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon's life. However, his family is
                        unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after
                        evading
                        his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's
                        side
                        and have him fully recovered, before sealing her powers completely to ensure that she can have a
                        normal life. Killua then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel the world with Alluka who
                        had
                        never seen the outside world before, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the
                        true
                        nature of his quest.

                        Some time later, Netero's son Beyond assembles an expedition to the Dark Continent (暗黒大陸, Ankoku
                        Tairiku). The forbidden, vast area outside of the known world that is sponsored by the Kingdom
                        of
                        Kakin. Fearing that the expedition may bring disaster to the world, just like it occurred in
                        previous attempts, the world's five greatest powers accept that Kakin join their ranks in
                        exchange
                        for full authority over its findings. To accompany Beyond and prevent him from doing something
                        unexpected, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him and invite Kurapika and Leorio to join them.
                        While
                        replacing Ging and the former Vice-Chairman Pariston, who assembled their own Dark Continent
                        exploration teams by Beyond's request.[14]

                        Meanwhile, Hisoka and Chrollo had their fight in Heaven's Tower. Chrollo designed a
                        sophisticated
                        strategy and applied a combination of stolen skills that overwhelmed and killed Hisoka. Still,
                        before dying, Hisoka used his Nen on his heart to wake his heart after death, and the tactic
                        worked
                        because Nen becomes stronger after death. After waking up, Hisoka humiliated Machi and killed
                        both
                        Kortopi and Shalnark, vowing to hunt the Phantom Troupe and kill it leg for leg before killing
                        Chrollo.

                        Aboard Kakin's expedition's ship, the fourteen princes of Kakin take part in a battle to the
                        death
                        called Succession War to decide the next king. In an attempt to recruit Kurapika to the Zodiacs,
                        Mizaistom Nana tells him that the 4th prince of Kakin has an extensive collection of eyes from
                        the
                        Kurta Clan.[14] Upon learning that, Kurapika immediately joins the Zodiacs as Pariston's
                        substitute
                        and infiltrates the royalty's security force along Pro Hunters he hired from the Hunter
                        Association,
                        most notable Izunavi, Basho, Melody, Biscuit, and Hanzo. Kurapika was hired to be the 14th
                        prince's
                        bodyguard and placed his fellow Pro Hunters strategically as bodyguards to other princes.
                        Members of
                        the Phantom Troupe (now includes Illumi) also infiltrate the ship targeting the treasures stored
                        in
                        the ship and revenge on Hisoka, who they suspect has boarded the ship too.

                        As the Succession War starts, Kurapika learns that the elder princes are in an advantageous
                        position, as they have been already preparing for the war for a long time. To revert the
                        situation
                        and create a stalemate position where he could help himself and the younger princes to survive,
                        Kurapika warns every prince and bodyguard about Nen and starts teaching Nen to the royalty's
                        security members who were not aware of Nen. Mizaistom and Botobai are investigating homicides
                        inside
                        the ship. They take notice of the consequences of the princes' struggles, and their ties to the
                        mafia, in the lower parts of the ship and start to take measures to avoid chaos and genocide
                        inside
                        the ship. The Phantom Troupe also takes notice of the existence of Kakin princes' ties to the
                        mafia.
                        While hunting Hisoka, Phinks, Feitan, and Nobunaga start to get close to the mafia faction tied
                        to
                        the 4th prince of Kakin, right at the moment when a mafia war on the lower levels starts.
