                    <p>Naruto (Japanese: ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
                        It
                        tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams
                        of
                        becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set
                        in
                        Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga
                        by
                        Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly
                        Hop
                        Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

                        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released
                        in
                        tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series
                        produced
                        by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English
                        adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden,
                        a
                        sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500
                        episodes.
                        The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98
                        episodes,
                        and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over
                        from
                        the first episode. The English adaptation is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day.
                        Besides
                        the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations
                        (OVAs).
                        Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed
                        by
                        several companies.

                        Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts
                        kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against
                        them
                        and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of
                        the
                        Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke
                        betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns
                        from
                        the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi received an order from Konoha's superiors to destroy his
                        clan
                        to prevent a coup. He accepted it on the condition that he would be allowed to spare Sasuke.
                        Saddened by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha
                        ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya
                        and
                        devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and
                        admiration.

                        With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers),
                        announces
                        that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to
                        control
                        all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him
                        and
                        instead join forces to confront Tobi and his allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi
                        World
                        War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces)
                        and
                        Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war,
                        in a
                        secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes
                        from
                        the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the
                        help of
                        Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.

                        During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's
                        who
                        was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As
                        Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's
                        downfall, he
                        decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans.
                        However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to
                        subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is
                        sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all
                        the
                        Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts
                        Sasuke
                        to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke
                        admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke
                        for
                        his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the
                        Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.

                        Historical context and Western influence
                        Samurai Champloo contains many scenes and episodes relating to historical occurrences in Japan's
                        Edo
                        period. In episode 5 ("Artistic Anarchy"), Fuu is kidnapped by the famous ukiyo-e painter
                        Hishikawa
                        Moronobu, a figure prominent in the Edo period's art scene.[5] Episode 23 ("Baseball Blues")
                        pits
                        the main characters in a baseball game against Alexander Cartwright and a team of American
                        baseball
                        players trying to declare war on Japan.[6] As for Western influences, the opening of the show as
                        well as many of the soundtracks are influenced by hip hop.[7] In episode 5, Vincent van Gogh is
                        referenced at the end in relation to Hishikawa Moronobu's ukiyo-e paintings.[8] A hip hop singer
                        challenges the main characters in episode 8 ("The Art of Altercation") and uses break dance
                        throughout.[9] In episode 18 ("War of the Words"), graffiti tagging, a culturally Western art
                        form,
                        is performed by characters as an artistic expression and form of writing. The ending of the
                        episode
                        has Mugen writing his name on the roof of Hiroshima Castle, the palace of the daimyō in Edo
                        Japan

                        When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as influences for his work and
                        tried
                        to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture.[13] The separation of
                        the
                        characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto
                        wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in
                        another.[14]
                        He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga,
                        beginning with volume 28.[10] He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a
                        counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.[15] As a
                        result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made
                        the
                        ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.[16]
