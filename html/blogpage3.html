                    <p>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a 2016 abomination anime television series
                        based on
                        Kentaro Miura's Berserk manga and a sequel to the Golden Age Arc film trilogy. This is a second
                        television adaptation of the manga after the 1997 anime of the same name, covering the
                        Conviction
                        arc from the manga. A second season, covering the first half of the Hawk of the Millennium
                        Empire
                        arc, aired in 2017.[6]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plot
                        The story follows Guts as the "Black Swordsman", an appearance which was briefly seen in the
                        first
                        episode of the 1997 television series as well as in the final scene of the Golden Age Arc
                        films.[7]

                        Guts was once a wandering mercenary taken in by the mercenary group known as the Band of the
                        Hawk
                        (鷹の団, Taka no Dan) and he fought alongside them before their mutilated leader, Griffith,
                        sacrificed
                        his followers to become one of the God Hand and continue his dream of ruling a kingdom of his
                        own.
                        Only Guts and his lover Casca, who lost her sanity and memory from the horrors she saw and
                        endured,
                        escaped the "Eclipse" ritual, though they were branded with marks that attract evil, restless
                        spirits and other similar entities. With Casca in the care of blacksmith Godo and his adopted
                        daughter Erica as well as Rickert, the only member of the Hawks absent during the Eclipse, Guts
                        set
                        off to hunt down the God Hand's Apostles to find and kill Griffith in a quest for vengeance.
                        Years
                        have passed, and Guts is joined in his hunt by an elf named Puck as events the God Hand have
                        long
                        waited for are beginning to unfold.

                        Guts (ガッツ, Gattsu) is a warrior who has faced the impossible since he was found beneath his
                        hanging
                        mother by a mercenary's wife. The mercenary, Gambino, agreed to adopt him, but after his wife's
                        death, Gambino forced the child Guts to fight as a mercenary. After losing his leg in a battle,
                        Gambino becomes a shadow of his cruel self, and sells Guts to a rapist for three coins. Guts
                        flees
                        after killing his adoptive father in self-defense, eventually growing into a young mercenary who
                        earned a fearsome reputation while fighting. Guts eventually catches the attention of Griffith,
                        the
                        angelically charismatic leader of the mercenary group, "Band of the Hawk" (鷹の団, Taka no Dan).
                        Griffith forces Guts into joining his forces upon defeating him in battle. Guts quickly rises
                        through the ranks of the mercenary group, eventually becoming the Hawks' renowned raid leader
                        and
                        Griffith's deadliest subordinate. They are hired by the kingdom of Midland to help win the
                        Hundred
                        Year War against the Tudor empire. During this time, Guts bonds with the Band of the Hawk and
                        learns
                        of Griffith's mysterious pendant, the Crimson Behelit, along with Griffith's dream to rule a
                        kingdom
                        of his own. When the Hawks encounter a monstrous immortal being known as Nosferatu Zodd, it adds
                        further mystery to the Behelit as Zodd spares Guts and Griffith upon seeing it, warning the
                        former
                        of his impending death should he be a true friend of Griffith's.

                        Berserk explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will and destiny are discussed within
                        the
                        series.[25][26][27] Human resilience is a recurring theme, with many characters coming from
                        horrible
                        backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world.[27][28] Guts struggles with destiny
                        itself, and is constantly resisting the pull of predetermination.[25] Griffith also embodies
                        this
                        idea of resilience, by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins,
                        as
                        well the free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk in order to achieve
                        his
                        dream.[27]

                        The series also explores human nature and morality, as characters struggle between becoming good
                        human beings or falling into madness and evil.[29][28] Guts, at the beginning of the story, is
                        presented as an antihero who does not care about killing, and is indifferent to people who aid
                        him.
                        Guts does not act in accordance with definitions of right and wrong, he operates within a gray
                        area,
                        and does not attempt to be heroic or protect the innocent.[30][31] However, as the story
                        progresses,
                        it is shown that he is in fact a person who is deeply conflicted internally.[32][33] His tragic
                        and
                        traumatic past, unfolded in the "Golden Age arc", proves that Guts is a much more complex
                        character.[34][30][28] Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network, wrote that Griffith is "not evil at
                        all", but "arrogant and brutally realistic about human nature". The suppression of his own human
                        nature would initiate his demise as the Hawk and the rise of Femto.[27]

                        Friendship, comradery and human relations are other explored themes.[25][11] As a child, Guts
                        tried
                        to build some level of friendship with his mercenary group,[35] but due to his traumatic
                        experience
                        with them, he lost trust in people.[36][37][38] Through the time he was with Griffith and the
                        rest
                        of the Band of the Hawk, Guts formed bonds, friendships, animosities, and co-dependencies,
                        maturing
                        as well as individual.[28][27][39][26] Miura has stated he based the Band of the Hawk on his own
                        high school friend relationship experience.[11][40] Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network, wrote
                        that
                        through their friendship, Gut's ambitions were elevated and Griffith's were lowered, allowing
                        both
                        of them to consider a new future for the first time, one where they fought side-by-side as
                        equals
                        and died on the battlefield, but they reject this future out of their own personal fears, as
                        Guts
                        did not think he was "good enough" for a happy future and Griffith was terrified of his lofty
                        dream
                        crumbling into something more mundane.[41] Miura has also stated that the story of fight between
                        Guts and Griffith speaks about their change after having built their personalities.[11]

                        The Golden Age arc has been compared to a Greek tragedy.[42][43] According to Lauenroth,
                        Griffith's
                        hamartia lies in how he compartmentalizes his feelings of guilt and shame that would get in the
                        way
                        of his dream, and how he deals to repress them. His inner dialogue in his second duel with Guts;
                        "If
                        I can't have him, I don't care", marks the Golden Age arc peripeteia.[27] When Guts comes
                        running to
                        rescue him, Griffith reaches his moment of anagnorisis, with his thought: "You're the only
                        one...
                        who made me forget my dream", initiating thus the Eclipse.[27]

                        Betrayal and revenge are major themes in the series. Guts suffered his first betrayal when
                        Gambino
                        sold Guts' body to another soldier for a few coins. He would eventually take revenge against the
                        soldier, killing him on the battlefield and he later would kill Gambino as well.[28][36] Guts is
                        in
                        a quest for revenge after his comrades were betrayed by Griffith and sacrificed by the God
                        Hand.[28]
                        This desire for vengeance has been his main reason of survival.[44][31]

                        Religion has been also touched in the series, mainly through the characters of Mozgus and
                        Farnese.
                        Miura has stated that he created Mozgus based on the concept of rigid personality to create a
                        fanatic religious character with no flexibility.[40] Farnese is presented as the figurehead of
                        the
                        Holy Iron Chain Knights, inquisitors tasked with burning heretics and witches at the stake.[45]
                        After her encounter with Guts, she finds it increasingly difficult to resolve her faith with the
                        atrocities she has become party to, as Guts, inversely, takes action against something he
                        disagrees
                        with. Guts denounces the very idea of prayer, claiming that the act of clasping hands only
                        prevents
                        people from realizing what they desire through their own means. After the battle between Guts
                        and
                        Mozgus, Farnese rejects her faith, as she realizes how blind she obeyed the rigidity of her
                        beliefs.[46]
